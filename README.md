# Django Dashboard

This Django project is composed of a lot more than just Django. Here you'll find a combination of webscraping, JSON rendering with the Django Rest Framework and even rendering Plotly's awesome Python visualisation libary: Dash.

## Getting started

Make sure you make migrations for each app with `python manage.py makemigrations app_name`

## Update

The code in this repository has been updated since the release of the [tutorial series](https://youtu.be/d85-j5j1ak0) on YouTube. It's advised to work through the tutorial series as it will show the concepts behind putting this project together, however, please note you will come across some errors which have been attempted to be patched in this latest version of the code.
